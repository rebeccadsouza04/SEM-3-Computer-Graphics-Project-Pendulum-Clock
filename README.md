# SEM-3-Computer-Graphics-Project-Pendulum-Clock
The aim of this project is to implement a pendulum clock which shows the current time and has a pendulum that oscillates in a to and fro movement.
The current time is set by using the function gettime() and the clock is then set to work all round unless the user presses the “ENTER”  key on the keyboard which is detected by the function khbit(). 
Various fill patterns too have been used to show a clear distinction in the clock.
